# quadratic_solver_newton_divisibility

The program calls the three functions below in order, and each receives input from the user to process accordingly.

- Reads three integers from the command prompt as coefficients of a quadratic equation and calculates the roots of the equation.
  If the roots are real, then the program prints the equation and the roots to the console in descending order.
  If the roots are complex numbers, then the program informs the user about the complex roots.
- Asks the user for three coefficients and an initial guess and applies Newton's Method 5 times.
  In each step, it compares the actual root and the estimated root (from Newton's method) and prints the difference.
  It is assumed that the user will not provide a function with complex roots.
- Asks for two integers, then calculates the divisibility of the first integer by the second one.
  If it is not divisible, it finds the closest divisible integer.
